# Dynamic2

This repository contains code for Dynamic Aperture and Dynamic Blocking algorithms as pertaining to Astronomical Photometry; see the more detailed "Dynamic Writeup.pdf" within for an explanation of what these algorithms are.  
Check the v2.0 README for an explanation of what the algorithms here do. I'm changing the code around to fix up some things I was doing stupidly, so I'll get around to writing this summary properly when I'm done. Thanks!
