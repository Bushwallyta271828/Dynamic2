Code for Dynamic Aperture and Dynamic Blocking algorithms as pertaining to Astronomical Photometry; see the more detailed "Dynamic Writeup.pdf" within for an explanation of what these algorithms are.  
The code is changing so fast right now there's no point in talking about it until I have settled with myself how the program is going to be laid out.
